# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

If you are using an unsupported version, it is highly recommended to upgrade to a supported version immediately to ensure the security of your application. 
Unsupported versions will not receive any security updates, and any vulnerabilities reported affecting those versions will not be addressed.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability in PySyslog, please send a detailed report via our secure email at security@pysyslog.com. 
We encourage you to include steps to reproduce the issue and any other information that might aid in resolving it.
Once a report is received, we will work diligently to confirm the existence of the vulnerability and then communicate our findings back to you.
You can expect an initial response within 48 hours of submission and regular updates on our progress every 72 hours thereafter.
If the vulnerability is verified, 
we will release a patch as soon as possible, depending on the complexity of the issue, and you will be credited for the discovery in the release notes, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
